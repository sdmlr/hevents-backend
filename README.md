# Hevents Backend

This is the backend API for the Hevents event management platform. It provides endpoints for managing events, user signups, and user role verification, leveraging Supabase for authentication and data storage.

## üìò Overview

This backend powers the Hevents frontend. It exposes RESTful API endpoints for:

* Fetching and managing events
* Signing up for events
* Fetching user roles (e.g., staff vs user)

It is deployed on Render and uses Supabase for authentication and database operations.
